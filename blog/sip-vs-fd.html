<h1>SIP vs FD: Which Is Better for Long-Term Investment?</h1>
<p class="article-meta">Educational guide · Long-term perspective</p>

<p>
SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) and Fixed Deposit (FD) are two of the most
popular investment options in India. While FDs are known for stability,
SIPs are associated with long-term wealth creation through mutual funds.
</p>

<h2>What Is SIP?</h2>
<p>
SIP allows you to invest a fixed amount regularly in mutual funds. The money
is invested in the market, which means returns are not guaranteed but can
grow significantly over time due to compounding.
</p>

<h2>What Is Fixed Deposit (FD)?</h2>
<p>
A Fixed Deposit is a traditional investment option offered by banks and
financial institutions. It provides a fixed interest rate and predictable
returns with low risk.
</p>

<h2>Key Differences Between SIP and FD</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SIP is market-linked; FD offers fixed returns</li>
  <li>SIP is suitable for long-term goals</li>
  <li>FD is suitable for capital protection</li>
  <li>SIP benefits from compounding over time</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tool</h2>
