<p class="article-meta">Educational guide · Beginner friendly</p>

<p>
SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) and Lump Sum are two popular ways of
investing in mutual funds. Both approaches have advantages depending
on financial goals and risk tolerance.
</p>

<h2>What Is SIP?</h2>
<p>
SIP allows you to invest a fixed amount at regular intervals.
It promotes disciplined investing and reduces market timing risk.
</p>

<h2>What Is Lump Sum Investment?</h2>
<p>
Lump sum investment involves investing a large amount at one time.
Returns depend heavily on market timing.
</p>

<h2>Key Differences</h2>
<ul>
  <li>SIP spreads risk over time</li>
  <li>Lump sum benefits from market lows</li>
  <li>SIP is suitable for salaried investors</li>
  <li>Lump sum suits investors with surplus funds</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which Is Better?</h2>
<p>
There is no universal answer. SIP is generally safer for beginners,
while lump sum may suit experienced investors.
