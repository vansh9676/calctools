<h1>BMI Categories Explained: Is Your Number Accurate?</h1>

<p class="article-meta">Updated: January 2025 · 6 Min Read · Health Guide</p>

<p>
  Body Mass Index (BMI) is the most common metric used by doctors and health organizations worldwide to screen for weight categories. 
  But seeing a number like "26.5" or "31.2" on a screen can be confusing. Is it dangerous? Is it normal?
</p>

<p>
  In this guide, we break down the standard World Health Organization (WHO) categories, explain the health risks associated with each, 
  and discuss why BMI might be lying to you if you are an athlete.
</p>

<h2>The Official BMI Categories (WHO Standard)</h2>
<p>
  Most adults fall into one of the following four categories. This standard applies to both men and women over the age of 20.
</p>

<div class="table-container">
  <table class="blog-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>BMI Range (kg/m²)</th>
        <th>Weight Status</th>
        <th>Health Risk Level</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Below 18.5</strong></td>
        <td>Underweight</td>
        <td>Moderate (Nutritional deficiency)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>18.5 – 24.9</strong></td>
        <td>Normal Weight</td>
        <td>Low Risk</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>25.0 – 29.9</strong></td>
        <td>Overweight</td>
        <td>Increased Risk</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>30.0 and Above</strong></td>
        <td>Obesity</td>
        <td>High Risk</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

<h2>Deep Dive: What Each Category Means for You</h2>

<h3>1. Underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5)</h3>
<p>
  Being underweight can be a sign of insufficient nutrition, high metabolism, or underlying health issues. 
  While some people are naturally thin, dropping below 18.5 may weaken your immune system and lead to bone fragility.
</p>

<h3>2. Normal Weight (BMI 18.5 – 24.9)</h3>
<p>
  This is the "sweet spot." People in this range statistically have the lowest risk of heart disease and diabetes. 
  However, "Normal Weight Obesity" exists—where you have a normal weight but high body fat percentage (often called "skinny fat").
</p>

<h3>3. Overweight (BMI 25 – 29.9)</h3>
<p>
  Crossing the 25 mark is a signal to be careful. While you may not feel "fat," excess weight in this range 
  starts putting pressure on your joints and slightly increases blood pressure.
</p>

<h3>4. Obesity (BMI 30+)</h3>
<p>
  This category is split into three classes (Class I, II, and III). A BMI over 30 is strongly linked to chronic conditions 
  like Type 2 Diabetes, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular issues.
</p>

<h2>The "Muscle Paradox": When BMI Fails</h2>
<p>
  One reason BMI is criticized is that it cannot distinguish between **fat mass** and **muscle mass**.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Example: The Bodybuilder Problem</strong><br>
  Imagine an athlete who is 5'10" and weighs 95kg. His BMI would be roughly <strong>30.5</strong>, classifying him as "Obese." 
  However, he might have 8% body fat and pure muscle.
</p>

<div class="table-container">
  <table class="blog-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>BMI is GOOD for...</th>
        <th>BMI is BAD for...</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>General population screening</td>
        <td>Professional athletes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Identifying sedentary lifestyle risks</td>
        <td>Pregnant women</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Quick medical assessments</td>
        <td>Elderly (who lose muscle mass)</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<h2>Other Ways to Measure Health</h2>
<p>
  If you suspect your BMI result is inaccurate because of muscle mass, consider checking these metrics instead:
</p>

<ul class="pros-list">
  <li><strong>Waist-to-Hip Ratio:</strong> Measures belly fat, which is more dangerous than hip fat.</li>
  <li><strong>Body Fat Percentage:</strong> Uses calipers or smart scales to distinguish fat from lean mass.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  BMI is a fantastic starting point, but it is not a diagnosis. If your calculator result shows you are "Overweight" or "Obese," 
  don't panic. Use it as a wake-up call to assess your diet and activity levels.
