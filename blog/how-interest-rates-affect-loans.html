<h1>How Interest Rates Affect Loans and EMIs</h1>
<p class="article-meta">Educational guide · Finance basics</p>

<p>
Interest rate is one of the most important factors when taking a loan.
Even a small change in interest rate can significantly impact your monthly
EMI and the total amount you repay over time.
</p>

<h2>What Is an Interest Rate?</h2>
<p>
An interest rate is the cost charged by lenders for borrowing money.
It is usually expressed as an annual percentage of the loan amount.
</p>

<h2>How Interest Rate Affects EMI</h2>
<p>
Higher interest rates increase your EMI or extend your loan tenure.
Lower interest rates reduce the overall cost of borrowing.
</p>

<h2>Example: Small Rate Change, Big Impact</h2>
<p>
A loan of ₹10 lakh at 8% interest for 20 years costs much less than
the same loan at 9%. Over long tenures, the difference can run into lakhs.
</p>

how different interest rates affect your monthly payment instantly.
</p>

<h2>Fixed vs Floating Interest Rates</h2>
<p>
Fixed rates remain constant, while floating rates change with market
conditions. Each has advantages depending on economic trends.
</p>

<h2>Why Understanding Interest Rates Matters</h2>
<p>
Borrowers who understand interest rates can choose better loan offers,
reduce total interest paid, and plan finances more responsibly.
