<h1>How EMI Is Calculated (With Formula & Practical Example)</h1>

<p class="article-meta">Educational guide · Updated regularly</p>

<p>
Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) is the fixed amount you pay every month
towards repaying a loan. Whether it is a home loan, car loan, or personal
loan, understanding how EMI is calculated helps you make better borrowing
decisions.
</p>

<h2>What Is EMI?</h2>
<p>
EMI consists of two components: the principal amount and the interest.
In the early years of a loan, a larger portion goes towards interest,
while later payments reduce the principal more significantly.
</p>

<h2>The EMI Formula</h2>
<p>
The standard EMI formula used by banks is:
</p>

<p>
<strong>EMI = [P × R × (1 + R)<sup>N</sup>] ÷ [(1 + R)<sup>N</sup> − 1]</strong>
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>P</strong> = Loan principal</li>
  <li><strong>R</strong> = Monthly interest rate (annual rate ÷ 12)</li>
  <li><strong>N</strong> = Loan tenure in months</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step EMI Example</h2>
<p>
Suppose you take a loan of ₹5,00,000 at an annual interest rate of 10%
for 5 years (60 months).
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Principal (P): ₹5,00,000</li>
  <li>Monthly Interest (R): 10% ÷ 12 = 0.00833</li>
  <li>Tenure (N): 60 months</li>
</ul>

<p>
Using the EMI formula, your monthly EMI comes to approximately ₹10,624.
</p>

<h2>How Interest Rate Affects EMI</h2>
<p>
Even a small change in interest rate can significantly impact your EMI.
Higher interest rates increase your monthly burden and total interest paid.
