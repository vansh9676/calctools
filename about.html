  <h1>About CalcTools</h1>

  <p>
    Welcome to CalcTools. We are a digital platform dedicated to simplifying complex numbers. 
    Whether you are planning a loan, tracking your fitness, or calculating investment returns, 
    our mission is to provide <strong>accurate, fast, and transparent</strong> tools.
  </p>

  <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
  <p>
    The internet is full of calculators, but many of them are cluttered with ads or hide the logic behind the results. 
    We believe you deserve to know <em>how</em> the answer was calculated. That is why every tool on our site comes with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clear Formulas:</strong> We show the math we use so you can verify the results.</li>
    <li><strong>Educational Guides:</strong> We explain what the numbers mean for your real life.</li>
    <li><strong>Privacy Focus:</strong> We do not store your financial inputs on our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Editorial Standards</h2>
  <p>
    Our content and tools are researched and tested for accuracy. We follow standard financial formulas (like the Reducing Balance method for EMIs) 
    and World Health Organization (WHO) standards for health metrics.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, we believe in responsible usage. While our algorithms are precise, financial markets and health metrics are complex. 
    We always encourage users to consult certified professionals for critical life decisions.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>
    We are constantly improving. If you find a bug or have a suggestion for a new calculator, 
    please reach out to us via our <a href="/contact.html" style="color:#38bdf8;">Contact Page</a>.

  <h2 class="section-divider">Our Calculation Standards</h2>
  <p>
    At CalcTools, we don't just build scripts; we build financial clarity. Our <strong>EMI and SIP tools</strong> are built using the <strong>Standard Reducing Balance Method</strong> and <strong>Compound Interest Formulas</strong> used by major Indian banking institutions. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Our <strong>Health Calculators</strong> follow the <strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> BMI classifications and <strong>Asian-specific BMI thresholds</strong> to ensure local relevance for our Indian users.

    <p><strong>Editorial Integrity:</strong> Every article on our blog is reviewed for mathematical accuracy before publication. We aim to provide unbiased data to help users avoid predatory lending and unrealistic investment expectations.</p>
