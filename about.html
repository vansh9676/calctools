  <h1>About CalcTools</h1>

  <p>
    CalcTools is an educational platform created to help users understand
    everyday calculations related to finance, health, and measurements.
    Our goal is to make numerical concepts easier to understand — not just
    to provide instant results.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many online calculator websites focus only on output. CalcTools focuses
    on clarity, explanations, and responsible usage so users can make
    informed decisions with confidence.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
  <p>
    We believe understanding numbers is essential for financial awareness,
    health tracking, and daily decision-making. CalcTools provides tools
    designed with learning and transparency in mind.
  </p>

  <h2>Important Note</h2>
  <p>
    CalcTools does not provide financial, medical, or professional advice.
    All tools are for educational and informational purposes only.
