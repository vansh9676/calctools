        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          CalcTools was created with a simple goal — to make financial planning easier and more accessible for everyone. Many people struggle to understand concepts like investments, loans, and taxes because the calculations behind them can be confusing. We built this platform to simplify those calculations into clear, practical tools that anyone can use without technical knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
          The platform focuses on accuracy, usability, and educational value. Instead of complicated spreadsheets or paid financial software, users can access free calculators that provide instant estimates for planning purposes. Whether someone is calculating SIP returns, planning a home loan, or estimating income tax, our tools aim to provide clarity for better financial decisions.

        <h2>About the Creator</h2>
        <p>
          CalcTools is developed and maintained by an independent creator focused on building practical digital tools for educational and financial awareness purposes. The project combines programming, financial research, and publicly available regulatory information to deliver accurate calculation tools for users worldwide.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal is not to replace professional financial advice but to provide reliable estimates that help users understand financial concepts and plan more effectively before consulting experts when necessary.

    <h2>Our Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      In an era of financial misinformation, CalcTools stands for mathematical truth. We do not offer "get rich quick" advice. We offer tools based on the fundamental laws of compounding, taxation, and amortization.

    <h2>Editorial Standards</h2>
    <p>
      Every calculator and guide on this site undergoes a rigorous 3-step verification process:
    </p>
    <ol style="margin: 20px 0 20px 20px; color:#d1d5db; line-height: 1.8;">
      <li><strong>Technical Development:</strong> Coded using standard financial formulas (e.g., Compound Interest Formula `A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)`).</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-Verification:</strong> Results are benchmarked against official bank calculators (SBI, HDFC) to ensure 99.9% accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance Check:</strong> Updated annually to align with the latest Union Budget (e.g., New Tax Regime Slabs for FY 2025-26).</li>
    </ol>
