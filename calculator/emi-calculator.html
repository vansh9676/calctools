  <h1>Understanding Your Loan Amortization Schedule</h1>
  <p>Most borrowers don't realize that in the first 5 years of a 20-year loan, nearly 80% of their EMI goes toward interest. This is called an <strong>Amortization Schedule</strong>.</p>

    <h2>What is EMI?</h2>
    <p>
      EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment. It is the fixed amount that a
      borrower pays every month to repay a loan. Each EMI consists of two parts:
      the principal portion and the interest portion.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the early years of a loan, a larger part of the EMI goes towards interest.
      As the loan tenure progresses, the interest component reduces and the
      principal repayment increases.
    </p>

    <h2>How EMI is Calculated</h2>
    <p>
      EMI is calculated using a standard mathematical formula that considers the
      loan amount, interest rate, and loan tenure. Even a small change in interest
      rate or tenure can significantly impact the EMI and total interest paid.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefits of Using an EMI Calculator</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps plan monthly finances</li>
      <li>Shows total interest burden</li>
      <li>Allows loan comparison across banks</li>
      <li>Prevents over-borrowing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>EMI for Different Loan Types</h2>
    <p>
      EMI calculation works similarly for home loans, car loans, and personal
      loans. However, interest rates and tenures differ significantly. Home loans
      usually have longer tenures and lower interest rates, while personal loans
      have higher rates and shorter durations.
    </p>

    <h2>Should You Choose Longer or Shorter Tenure?</h2>
    <p>
      Longer tenure reduces EMI but increases total interest paid. Shorter tenure
      increases EMI but saves interest. Choosing the right tenure depends on your
      income stability and financial goals.
    </p>
      <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>
      <p>
        BMI does not directly measure body fat and may not accurately represent
        athletes, elderly individuals, or children. People with the same BMI
        may have different health profiles.
        </p>

      <p>
        BMI should be used only as a general indicator and not as a medical
        diagnosis.
      </p>
